# Understanding TypeScript - 2022

A Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzmuller

## Section 1: Getting Started

##### `Originally Started & Completed: 11/19/2021`

### What Is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It?

What is TypeScript

- TypeScript is a JavaScript Superset
  - It's a language that builds up on JavaScript
- Adds new features + advantages to JavaScript
- Disadvantage: TS can't be executed by JS environments like the browser
- NodeJS also can't execute TS
- A programming language **and** a tool!

  - It's a powerful compiler which you run over your code to compile TS code to JS

- How can TS add new features if what you get in the end is regular JS?
  - Features are compiled to JS "workarounds", possible errors are thrown
  - Nicer syntax / easier way, then compile that into a more complex JavaScript snippet you don't have to write!
  - Identify errors in code earlier before script runs!

Why TypeScript?

Example:

```js
funciton add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
console.log(add("2, "3"));
```

- Avoid unwanted behavior at runtime
- (Of course we could mitigate errors by adding if check to the add function, or validate & sanitize user input)
- Developers can still write invalid code this way!

### Installing & Using TypeScript

Going back to the same example, since all inputs in JavaScript are strings, regardless of input type, we would get errors if try to add two numbers from user input and run them through our _add_ method. We could spend some time to mitigate errors:

```js
...
if (typeof num1 === "number" && typeof num2 ==="number") {
    return num1 + num2;
} else {
    return +1num + +num2;
}
```

But we want to make sure that we can never pass strings into this _add_ method to begin with. That's where TypeScript can help us!

We can install TypeScript with npm (therefore we need NodeJS):
`npm install --g typescript` and compile with `tsc helloworld.ts`

Our TypeScript version looks like this:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const input1 = document.getElementById('num1')! as HTMLInputElement;
const input2 = document.getElementById('num2')! as HTMLInputElement;

function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log(add(parseInt(input1.value), +input2.value));
});
```

Here, we explicitely tell TypeScript that we know our inputs are going to return non-null values, and specifically they will be of HTMLInputElement.
We also tell TypeScript that we expect the _add_ method will accept number arguments. Lastly, when we call _add_, TypeScript enforces that the values being passed are of type _number_, so we can parse our inputs into an Int or add "+" in front of them -- both result in conversion to a number.

### TypeScript Advantages - Overview

TypeScript Overview

- TypeScript adds...
  - Types!
    - IDEs can give us better autocompletion and built-in errors by understanding types!
  - Next-gen JavaScript features (compiled down for older browsers)
    - A bit like Babel, but already built into TS
  - Non-JavaScript features like Interfaces and Generics, which cannot be compiled to JS
  - Meta-programming features like Decorators (explained later -- they're amazing, though!)
  - Rich configuration options! Can make it behave in exactly the way you want it to
  - Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TS projects
    - VS Code can give better support even in plain JS files, just by it being aware of TS!

### The Course Project Setup

We create a template project that will serve as a starter for each project in the course. It's a simple skeleton HTML file that links a script called "app.js", along with an "app.ts" file that we will compile to app.js via `tsc app.ts`

## Section 2: TypeScript Basics & Basic Types

##### `Originally Started & Completed: 11/19/2021`

### Module Introduction

In this section, we will learn the core syntax and features of TypeScript, as well as how to work with the basic types it provides

### Using Types

TypeScript adds many more types to the JavaScript language, and enables you to write your own types

Core Types (JS already knows)

- number
  - Only one number type; no special type for integers vs floats
  - Other programming languages have other types, like floats, doubles, etc
- string
  - "Hi", 'Hi', `Hi`
  - All text values
- boolean
  - true, false
  - Just these two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values

In TypeScript, we specify what type of values we want by adding `: <type>` after the variable, as in:

```js
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {}
```

The default type is `any` (as in, "I don't care what the type is")

**NOTE** that TypeScript's type system only helps you during _development_ (i.e before the code gets compiled)

### TypeScript Types vs JavaScript Types

In JavaScript, we can use `typeof` to get the type of a certain value: `console.log(typeof number1)` would give "number"

The key difference is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), and TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development)

Sometimes it is useful to check the type of something at runtime. But other times, it's nice to know it during development! With TypeScript, we **only** get the support during development, not runtime.

### Working with Numbers, Strings & Booleans

Example using the 3 core types:

```js
function add(n1: number, n2: number, showResult: boolean, phrase: string) {
  if (showResult) console.log(`${phrase} ${n1 + n2}`);

  return n1 + n2;
}

const number1 = 5;
const number2 = 2.8;
const printResult = true;
const resultPhrase = 'Result is: ';

const result = add(number1, number2, printResult, resultPhrase);
```

### Type Assignments & Type Inference

TypeScript has **type inference** -- does its best to understand which type you have in certain constants / variables. So when we do:
`const number1 = 5;` we don't have to specify that number1 is a number -- it's inferred! Actually, when we use contant, TypeScript not only infers its type as a number, but specifically "5".

Although we could do `const number1: number = 5;` it is actually considered bad practice to be so redundant. The only time we may want to do this is if we were not initializing it to a value: `let number1: number;`

### Object Types

The 4th core type that TypeScript supports is the object type.

Object Type

- { age: 30 }
- Any JS object. More specific types (type of objects) are possible

Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript warns us during development if we try to access a property that does not exist on an object. It infers each property (and its type) the object has during development.

Object **types** in TypeScript are used to describe the type of object that is to be used. Instead of commas, TypeScript shows semi-colons, as follows:

```js
const person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}
```

Note here is the syntax TS shows as our type for this object (shape, if you will) that an object of type "person" must have to be valid.
We can tell TypeScript that we do want to work with just a generic object by doign:

```js
const person: object = {
  name: 'Matthew',
  age: 34,
};
```

We can also leave off the `: object` part, but it will not be inferred as a generic object.

If we leave the `: object`, doing something like `person.name` will give us a warning, that name does not exist. This is because TS just thinks this is a generic object, and does not know to expect a name property. That's why it's better to drop the `: object`, so TS and intellisense can help us understand what properties a person has!

We can also do the following, which is similar to specifying type `object`:

```js
const person: {} = {
  name: 'Matthew',
  age: 30,
};
```

But then we can get more detailed, and define exactly what our object shape should be!

```js
const person: {
  name: string,
  age: number,
} = {
  name: 'Matthew',
  age: 30,
};
```

Although we can do the above, since we are immediately assigning values to the name and age anyways, it's a little redundant. So it's best to have TS infer.

### Array Types

The 5th core value type we have in JavaScript, that TS also covers, is the Array

Array

- [1, 2, 3]
- Any JS array is supported. Types can be flexible or strict (regarding the element types)

### Working with Tuples

TypeScript adds several new types that JavaScript does not know

Tuple Type

- Example: [1, 2]
- Added by TypeScript: It is a fixed-length, fixed-type array

```js
const person: {
  name: string,
  age: number,
  hobbies: string[],
  role: [number, string],
} = {
  name: 'Matthew',
  age: 34,
  hobbies: ['Coding', 'Gaming'],
  role: [2, 'author'],
};
```

Here, we have to specify that the "role" property is a Tuple. Otherwise TS will assume it's an array that can hold either string or number. To define a tuple, we simply use brackets, and a comma-seperated list of types that represent the data we want in the tuple. These will be the _exact_ order we expect to assign to this property. This tells TypeScript: "I want to have a special array with exactly 2 elements, the first being a number and the second being a string." Any assignments to "role" must conform to this ruleset. So `person.role[1] = 10;` would not work, as we want a string in the 2nd position.

But `person.role.push("admin");` works. Why? We told TS we only want 2 elements.

- Push is an exception, which is allowed in Tuples. Unfortunately TS cannot catch that error.

With Tuples, TypeScript provides us some support regarding the length. We will get errors if we have too few or too many arguments inside our brackets when assigning a value to that Tupe property: `person.role = [0]; // not allowed!` `person.role = [0, "Admin", "user"]; // not allowed!`

If you have a scenario where you need exactly _x_ amount of values in an array, and you know the type of each, consider using a Tuple over an Array. You'll get even more strictness into the app!

### Working with Enums

Enum Type

- JavaScript does not know this type (though other languages do, such as C#)
- `enum {NEW, OLD}`
- Added by TS: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
- Human readable labels you can work with

Enums can be declared as follows:

```js
enum Role = { ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR };
```

**NOTE** It is fairly standard to uppercase the name of the enum, so we know it is an Enum / custom TypeScript type!

**Important:** You will often see enums with all-uppercase values, but that's not a _must-do_. You can go with _any_ value names

By default, the first identifier is assigned to the number 0, and each one thereafter is incremented by 1. You can change the starting value (or give each identifier a custom value) as follows:

```js
enum Role = { ADMIN = 3, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR }; // READ_ONLY is = 4, and AUTHOR is = 5
enum Role = { ADMIND = 5, READ_ONLY = "READ_ONLY", AUTHOR = 10 };
```

Enums are a great construct when you want identifiers that are human-readable and have some mapped value behind the scenes.

### The any Type

The final core type is the `any` type

Any

- Any kind of value. No specific type assignment
- Really flexible
- Avoid when possible! It takes away all advantages TypeScript gives you. You're basically just treating a variable as if it were plain JavaScript
- Instead, either explicitely set it to a type or let TS use its powerful inference
- Can use as a fallback when you have data that you _really_ can't know what type it may be (but provide some runtime type checking)

### Union Types

A Union type is one that can accept more than one type ("union").

For example, we could rewrite our "add" method to "combine" either a number or a string:

```js
function combine(input1: number | string, input2: number | string) {
  return input1 + input2;
}

const combinedAges = combine(30, 26);
const combinedNames = combine('Matthew', 'Caitlin');
```

**IMPORTANT** to note that TypeScript will give us an error: `Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'string | number' and 'string | number'` But this is not actually correct! This should work -- we _can_ concatanate strings with numbers. But TypeScript only sees that we have a Union type, and doesn't actually analyze what's in the union type. It thinks: "Okay, you're expecting multiple types. Maybe that includes types where we cannot use the "+" operator, so I will complain!"

We can work around this issue by adding runtime type checking:

```js
function combine(input1: number | string, input2: number | string) {
  let result;
  if (typeof input1 === 'number' && typeof input2 === 'number') {
    result = input1 + input2;
  } else {
    result = input1.toString() + input2.toString();
  }
  return result;
}
```

These runtime checks aren't always required when working with Union types, but often will be because the flexibility provided. You might need different logic depending on what type of value you are actually dealing with.

### Literal Types

Literal Types

- Very clear about the _exact_ value that should be assigned
- `const val = 2.8` for instance. We are saying that we expect the exact value of 2.8

Example usage:

```js
function add(
  num1: number,
  num2: number,
  resultType: 'round-up' | 'round-down'
) {
  if (resultType === 'round-up') {
    return Math.ceiling(num1 + num2);
  } else {
    return Math.floor(num1 + num2);
  }
}
```

In the above, any string besides "round-up" or "round-down" will not be allowed. Often used in the context of a Union type (as it being the only allowed string would not make sense at all).

### Type Aliases Custom Types

TypeScript also features "type alias". We use the special TS keyword "type", followed by the name we wish to call the type, followed by the type(s) we want to encode in our alias.

### Type Aliases Custom Types

```js
type Rounding = 'round-up' | 'round-down';
function add(num1: number, num2: number, resultType: Rounding) {
  // Etc..
}
```

This is especially useful for Union types, as we don't have to type each individual type each time. We can, of course, use it with the core types as well:
`type Combinable = number | string;`

This allows us to be more concise and descriptive.

### Function Return Types & void

TypeScript is very good at inferring what our return type is from a function. But we can explicitely state it as well. To do so, we simply put a colon after the parameter list, followed by the type we wish to be returned by the function:

```js
function add(n1: number, n2: number): string {
  return n1.toString() + n2.toString();
}
```

- Again, it's best to let TypeScript infer the return type when possible.

The void Return Type

- We can also return a type that doesn't exist in regular JavaScript (but does in some other languages): `void`
- This specifies that nothing at all is returned.
- Interestingly, if we print the results of a function that returns nothing, we get `undefined` as a value in JavaScript.
- To confuse matters even more, we can use `undefined` as a type in TypeScript: `let someValue: undefined;`
- To confuse even more, a function is not allowed to have a `undefined` return type!

  - For this scenario, the only valid use of `undefined` in a return type is when we are simply returning, with no value: `return;`
  - We can also use the `void` return type in a function that simply returns `return;` aas well.

TLDR: Probably use `void` in all scenarios where a function does not return a value.

### Functions as Types

Function Types

We can ensure a value can only be set to a function as follows: `let combineValues: Function;`

So we could set `combineValues` to our `add` method, and then call it later:

```js
combineValues = add;
combineValues(8, 9); // Returns 17
combineValues = 5; // Appropriately gives an error, since 5 is not a function
```

This is a good start, but this doesn't ensure us much. We could easily set `combineValues` to _any_ function -- even one that doesn't even accept as many arguments as the one we desired. TypeScript will not complain, but we will not get the result we want.

Can we be more precise in defining how the function should look like? Yes! With Function Types:

```js
let combineValues: (a: number, b: number) => number;
function print(text: string) {
  console.log(text);
}
combineValues = print; // Rightfully TS does not allow this now!
```

This tells TypeScript that `combineValues` should accept _any_ function, but _only_ if they return a number, accept a number as their first argument, and accept a number as their second argument.

### Function Types & Callbacks

We can also work with Callbacks

```js
function addAndHandle(n1: number, n2: number, cb: (num: number) => void) {
  const result = n1 + n2;
  cb(result);
}

addAndHandle(10, 20, (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

(Confusing, should re-watch this video again!)

In the above, we are not forced to pass in a callback that does not return anything. It just tells us that anything we might return will not be used.

### The unknown Type

There is another TypeScript type, called `unknown`

```js
let userInput: unknown;
userInput = 5;
userInput = 'Matthew';
```

In the above, re-assignment to the userInput variable is allowed. So in this way, it seems like `unknown` is just like `any`. But consider:

```js
let userName: string;
userName = userInput; // Not allowed!
```

Whereas with `any` as the type for `userInput`, such an assignment would be allowed. The following, however, would be allowed:

```js
if (typeof userInput === 'string') userName = userInput;
```

In the above, TypeScript is smart enough to determine that userInput is guaranteed to be a string due to the if-statement.

- We need such a type-check in order to assign a value of type `unknown` to a value with a fixed type.

Use it in scenarios where you think: "I can't tell exactly what type I'll store in there, but I know what I want to do with it eventually."

As with `any`, not ideal to use too often. But this makes `unknown` better than `any`, since there's at least some amount of type-checking

### The never Type

`never` is another type that functions can return.

- Used in functions that, well, _never_ will return anything.
- For instance, a function that _throws_ an error; it results in a crash of sorts, and will genuinely never return a result. If we tried to console.log such a function, nothing would be printed (in contrast to `undefined` being printed in functions that also have no explicit return)

```js
function generateError(message: string, code: number): never {
  throw { message: message, errorCode: code };
}

console.log(generateError('An error occured!', 500)); // Nothing is printed
```

Although we could get by without specifying any return type in the previous function, or put `void` as the return type (which is also the inferred type TypeScript will assume anyways), it is best to specify `never` to be really clear about the functions behavior.

Another function that would never return is a function with an infinite loop!

### Wrap Up

Whew! Learned a lot...

- Thorough look at all the core types and the basics of TypeScript!
- How to create and assign types
- How to assign types to variables and params and why we do that
- How type assignments in TS differ from JS type checks
- Built JS code doesn't include any type assignments
- Look at number, string, boolean, function types, setting return types, argument types, describing the type of an overall function
- A look at objects, arrays, enums, tuples
- Look at type aliases, where you can merge complex types into an alias
- Literal types and union types, which can be useful in scenarios where you expect more than one possible types
- unknown and never, which are niche types but can be very useful

## Section 4: Next-Generation JavaScript & TypeScript

##### `Originally Started & Completed: 11/20/2021`

### Module Introduction

We'll take a look at more modern JavaScript syntax, and how TypeScript handles it.

### let and const

Great reference for JS features, which browsers support them, and which compilers support them: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

Added in JavaScript ES6 or more recent are some important features. We will examine a few of them.

- `const` is a variable type which cannot be changed. TypeScript throws an error when we try to make a reassignment to a `const` variable.
- `let` is a variable which can be changed. It is similar to `var` (which you should not use any more).
- `let` and `const` have different scopes than `var`
  - `var` has global and function scope (variables outside of functions available everywhere, those defined in functions only available there)
  - With `var`, JS doesn't know any other scope besides function and global, so using `var` in an if-statement makes the variable available globally -- not ideal!
- `let` and `const` introduce the concept of block scope -- always available in the block you define it or lower block. Blocks almost always snippet surrounded by curly braces

### Arrow Functions

Another major feature added in ES6 were _arrow functions_.

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

A benefit of this syntax is it is shorter, since apparently the word _function_ was too long to type. It also has even more concise variations

- If you have just one expression, you can omit the curly braces and remove the return statement (make sure it's all on one line):

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

If you have a function that only takes one parameter, you can omit the parantheses.

```js
const printOutput = (output) => console.log(output);
```

(**NOTE** that if you have _no_ parameters, you _have to_ use an empty pair of parentheses: `() => { ... }`)

However, in TypeScript we need to provide more for the above printOutput to work, as it is not happy we don't specify the type for output:

```js
const printOutput: (out: number | string) => void = (output) =>
  console.log(output);
```

So with that example, the variation syntax isn't really shorter. But an example where it would be:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
if (button) {
  button.addEventListener('click', (event) => console.log(event));
}
```

Since TypeScript knows what `addEventListener` will provide to us (event object), TS can infer this, so you don't have to specify the function type anywhere.

### Default Function Parameters

Another nice function feature in modern JS is the ability to assign default arguments to function parameters.

```js
// Second argument will have its value as 10 if none passed into the call
const add = (a: number, b: number = 10) => a + b;
add(1); // Returns 11 (1 + default 10)
```

**Important** to note that the default arguments must be last in the parameter list. Makes sense; if we skip an argument, it's hard to know which argument we are omitting unless they come last. JS / TS do not look at your function definition and guess which one you are attempting to target or omit.

### The Spread Operator (...)

Arrays and Objects also received useful features in modern JavaScript.

If we want to extract _all_ values of an array:

```js
const hobbies = ['Coding', 'Gaming'];
const activeHobbies = ['Hiking'];

// Pass all elements in hobbies array to the activeHobbies array
activeHobbies.push(...hobbies);
// Doing this would push the entire array as a SINGLE 3rd element to hobbies
// activeHobbies.push(hobbies);
```

(Note that we _can_ push to a constant since arrays are objects, and objects are reference values. When we push we change the memory but not the actual address.)

This `...` syntax, when used in this context, is the _spread operator_. It tells JavaScript to pull out all elements of that array and add them as a list of individual values in the place where the operator was used.

You can also use it when creating a new array:

```js
const hobbies = ['Coding', 'Gaming'];
const activeHobbies = ['Hiking', ...hobbies];
```

The _spread operator_ also exists on Objects.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Matthew',
  age: 34,
};

const copiedPerson = { ...person };
```

This is useful because it creates an actual copy of the object, rather than just telling JavaScript that both variables _point_ to the same position in memory:

```js
// Valid, but now both point to the same object and changing one will change both. Not always what we want.
const copiedPerson = person;
```

The _spread operator_ in this context pulls out all the key/value pairs and they are added to the new object.

### Rest Parameters

Related to the _spread operator_ is the concept of _rest parameters_.

Let's say we want our "add" function to be able to receive as many arguments as we wish. In the place where we expect a list of values (so not where we pass it, but where we want to accept it as incoming values), we can do use the `...` syntax:

```js
const add = (...numbers: number[]) => {
  return numbers.reduce((currentResult, currentValue) => {
    return currentResult + currentValue;
  }, 0);
};

add(5, 10, 2, 3); // Valid
```

Note in the above example we made use of the `reduce` method. It is very useful to know how it works! Overall, it returns a value. As its first argument, it receives a function, of which itself has 2 paramters (the overall result, and the current value). For each item in the array, the function passed into `reduce` will do the logic you specify using the current value and the current result.

Also note that when we call the `add` method, we do not pass an array of numbers! Rather, we are passing a list of individual numbers. Though we could pass an array, by using our new-found knowledge of the _spread operator_!:

```js
const nums = [5, 10, 2, 3];
add(...nums); // Passes in each element from the nums array, as a list of individual elements
```

It's easy to see how the concept of _rest parameters_ is useful for accepting an unlimited amount of arguments. In fact, the `push` method uses _rest params_ to allow a coma-seperated list of items to be pushed.

In TypeScript, we can combine this concept with Tuples! If we know we want to support multiple arguments **but** know how many there will be:

```js
const add = (...numbers: [number, number, number, number]) => { ... };
```

Note that in the type definition we stil had to explicitely specify that we want the Tuple to contain 4 numbers. The alternative would have been lengthier:

```js
const add = (num1: number, num2: number, num3: number, num4: number) => { ... };
```

### Array & Object Destructuring

Another nice syntax modern JavaScript provides with arrays and objects is **destructuring**.

```js
const hobbies = ['Coding', 'Gaming', 'Cooking', 'Guitar-ing'];
const hobby1 = hobbies[0];
const hobby2 = hobbies[1];
const hobby3 = hobbies[2];
const hobby4 = hobbies[3];

// Same as above, but shorter!
const [hob1, hob2, hob3] = hobbies;
```

This will go through the hobbies array, store the first element to a constant with "hob1" as name, the second element to "hob2", etc.

We can combine it with _rest params_ even! All remaining elements not specified will be merged together in an array:

```js
const [hobby1, hobby2, ...remainingHobbies] = hobbies;
// remaining hobbies is now an array storing "Cooking" and "Guitar-ing"
```

**Note** that we are not _removing_ these values from the "hobbies" array. We are simply copying them to new variables.

Objects can also be _destructured_:

```js
const person = { firstName: 'Matthew', age: 34, hobbies: ['Gaming', 'Coding'] };
const { firstName, hobbies } = person;
// We now have variables "firstName" and "hobbies", which store the values associated to those properties in our person object
```

With objects, we are retrieving properties with the exact firstName specified, so the order does not matter like it does with array destructuring.

We can also override the name of the property if we wish to call it something more fitting for our given context:

```js
const { firstName: userName, age } = person;
// userName stores "Matthew". firstName does not store anything
```

Here we are saying find the property called "firstName" from the person object, but set its value to the "userName" variable rather than "firstName". This creates an alias of sorts.

Again, as with arrays, the Object itself is not changed. We are just copying key/values out of it.

### How Code Gets Compiled & Wrap Up

TypeScript not only compiles your code from TypeScript-only features into corresponding, valid JavaScript -- it also compiles modern JavaScript to old, more-supported JavaScript **if** we tell it to do so. This is done by setting the compiler options appropriately, to target "es5" rather than "es6". This makes the compiled JavaScript version of our TypeScript code larger and more complex in order to do workarounds and re-create the ES6 features (rest params, destructuring, arrow functions, spread, etc) for use in ES5.

## Section 5: Classes & Interfaces

##### `Originally Started & Completed: 11/20/2021`

### Module Introduction

In this module, we will dive into classes and interfaces.
Classes already exist in modern JavaScript. Interfaces are entirely new, though!
We will expolore what these things are and why we use them. We will explore classes and the concept of inheritance. We will also explore Interfaces

### What Are Classes

What's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

- Work with (real-life) entities in your code. "Objects" that resemble real-life objects.
- In an online shop, we might have a ProductList object, which has everything we need to manage a ProductList.
  - Renders a list of products which were fetched from a server.
  - Might also have an individual Product object, responsible for managing a single product
    - Renders details about a product and allows addition to cart
    - Holds rendering + cart-adding logic
  - Might also have a ShoppingCart object, etc!

Classes & Instances

- Objects:
  - The concrete things we work with in our code (data structures we use to store data, execute methods on, etc)
  - An object is said to be an _instance_ of a class if it is based on that class
  - Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals
- Classes:
  - The _blueprints_ for objects
  - Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
  - Classes exist to speed up the creation of objects!
  - Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
- This pattern allows us to quickly replicate multiple objects with the same structure / methods based on the same class. They might only differ in the exact data details, like Person objects who share the same behavior but differ in name and age.

### Creating a First Class

- In a way, classes are syntatic sugar for JavaScript's _Constructor functions_
- Convention to start a class name with an uppercase character

```js
class Department {
  // name is a "field" of the class
  name: string;

  // Function tied to this class, executed when object is being created
  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n;
  }
}

// Creates a new JS object based on the Department blueprint
const accounting = new Department('Accounting');
```

### Compiling to JavaScript

If not using the latest version of JavaScript (where the field syntax is supported), we will see the above TypeScript class code compiled into ES6 like:

```js
'use strict';
class Department {
  constructor(n) {
    this.name = n;
  }
}
```

But if we have TypeScript compile into ES5 code... we see something entirely different (and rather gross!):

```js
'use strict';
var Department = (function () {
  function Department(n) {
    this.name = n;
  }
  return Department;
})();
```

This is a _constructor function_, which is vanilla, non-modern JavaScript's way of creating object blueprints. So, the idea of having blueprints for objects has been around a long time in JavaScript, just in a very...very unintuitive way. Classes are the modern, syntax-friendly way to do this.

### Constructor Functions & the "this" Keyword

You can also add methods to Classes / constructor functions! The constructor method is a utility function when you _instantiate_ an object.

```js
class Department {
  // name is a "field" of the class
  name: string;

  // Function tied to this class, executed when object is being created
  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n;
  }

  describe() {
    console.log('Department: ', this.name);
  }
}

// Creates a new JS object based on the Department blueprint
const accounting = new Department('Accounting');
accounting.describe(); // The "this" in this.name in Department.describe now refers to the accounting object
```

Note we do not use a colon after the method name; it is not a property of an object, after all!

To refer to a Class property or method from inside of the Class, we have to use the `this` keyword.
The `this` keyword can be a bit tricky!

```js
const accountingCopy = { describe: accounting.describe };
accountingCopy.describe(); // Undefined! "this" is accountingCopy, which has no property called name
```

In general, we can _typically_ think of `this` as being the thing that is responsible for calling a method. In the above example, accountingCopy called the describe method, and that is an object with no property of name.

In TypeScript, we signal that we want the "this" inside of our describe method to always refer to an instance based on the Department class:

```js
describe(this: Department) {
  console.log("Department: ", this.name);
}
```

- Now TypeScript would warn us of an error when trying we have our accountingCopy object attempt to call "describe" -- as it should, since accountingCopy is not an instance of Department.
- TypeScript would also be happy if we also just gave accountingCopy a "name" property: `const accountingCopy = { name: "Accounting", describe: accounting.describe }`. So it would not fuss about it calling "describe", even though we technically did not create it based off a Department class:

### Private and Public Access Modifiers

Classes often get more complex than what we've been seeing so far. If we have a complex Class that uses an array internally to store a list of employees, for example, we would typically provide a method (addEmployee(employeeName)) to facilitate the process of adding an employee to this list. We may then want to prohibit direct access to the employees array that the Class is using.

- We can do so with `private` properties. We simply add the `private` keyword in front of a property or method.
- This signals that the property / method marked with `private` is only accessible from within the Class itself.
- This is considered an **access modifier**.
- There is `private` and `public` (with public being the default).

- In the past, JavaScript had no notion of the public/private -- all properties were always public. But modern JavaScript allows this concept (**not** with the `private` and `public` keyword, though) -- and naturally TypeScript does as well! TypeScript allows this at runtime to check for errors, even if compiling to an older version of JavaScript that does not actually provide functionality for access modifiers.

### Shorthand Initialization

Consider a typical Class with many fields:

```js
class Department {
  private id: string;
  name: string;
  private employees: string[] = [];
  private location: string;

  constructor(id: string, n: string, loc: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = n;
    this.location = loc;
  }
}
```

Notice all the duplicate code; we have to declare our fields up top, and if we want them initialized in the constructor we have to pass them as arguments, and then set the field properties to those argument's values. There's a shorthand that can reduce the code needed to be typed:

```js
class Department {
  private employees: string[] = []; // We keep as a field; we do not initialize in constructor

  constructor(private id: string, public name: string, private location: string) {
    // No explicit initialization needed!
  }
}
```

Several things to consider:

- Result: For every argument in the constructor, a property of the same name is created, and the value for the argument is stored in that created property.
- The argument names **must** be the same as the field names! If we specify an argument called "loc" (short for location), it produced a field with _that_ name.
- We **must** provide an access modifier (`private` or `public`).

### readonly Properties

Another modifier (but not an _access_ type) is the `readonly` modifier.

- Marks that the property should not change
- This keyword was introduced by TypeScript. It **does not** exist in JavaScript!
- Can't write to the property after it is initialized
- A way to clearly mark that we do not wish for this value to ever be altered

How is readonly different than const?

- They are essentially the same, except readonly is used with class/interface properties, while const is expected to be used with variables.
- readonly is cehcked only during type-checking (compile time) while const is checked during runtime
- Declaring a property readonly doesn't mean that its value can't be changed: It means that the property cannot be re-assigned, example:

```js
interface Person {
  readonly info: { name: string; age: number };
}

// Create a new person
// ...

person.info.age += 1; // This is valid!
person.info = { name: "Matthew", age: 34 }; // This is invalid!
```

- Another difference, in regards to Arrays, is you can push / pop / reassign individual elements of an Array when using `const`. But with `readonly`, such operations will produce an error.

### Inheritance

If we have specialized versions of a particular class, it may be useful to _inherit_ from that Class, while extending its properties / functionality.

- In JavaScript, we can do so with the `extends` keyword in the Class declaration:

```js
class AccountingDepartment extends Department {}
```

- You can only inherit from one class (unlike some languages, such as C#)
- The class which is inheriting automatically gets everything the parent class has, including its constructor (if we don't provide our own)
- But we can add our own constructor, making sure we call `super` in the constructor. It **must** be included, and called like a function:

```js
class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
  // public admins: string[]; // Given this due to shorthand syntax
  constructor(id: string, public admins: string[]) {
    super(id, 'Accounting');
  }
}

const accountingDept = new AccountingDepartment("A1", ["Matthew", "Caitlin"]);
```

- The call to `super` **must** take arguments of the parent class constructor.
- You have to call `super` first in the constructor before doing anything involving the `this` keyword!

### Overriding Properties & the Protected Modifier

We can also **override** methods and properties of our base class. We do this simply by defining said methods in our child class. Overriding methods allows us to tweak how a specialized version of the parent class handles certain behavior.

Private properties are only accessible from within the Class they are **defined** -- so not even inherited Classes have access to them. If we want to ensure inherited classes can access something, but not to outside classes, we can use the `protected` keyword:

```js
class Animal {
  // This class and its children can access this, but no others
  protected name: string;

  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n;
  }

  speak(text: string) {
    console.log(text);
  }

  setName(n: string) {
    this.name = n;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(n, public breed: string) {
    super(n);
  }

  // Override the Animal.Speak method
  speak(text: string) {
    this.bark(text);
  }

  // Specific to Dog -- Animal does not have this
  bark(text: string) {
    console.log(`Woof! My name is ${this.name} and ${text}!`);
  }
}

const snake = new Animal('Snakey');
const dog = new Dog('Leon', 'Chow');
dog.bark('I GOOD BOI');
// dog.name; // Not allowed! Name is protected!
```

- Like the other modifier keywords, `protected` is a TypeScript-only keywords: JavaScript does not know this!

### Getters & Setters

**Getter**

Getters and setters are another useful feature with Classes, and are also available in vanilla JavaScript.

A _getter_ is basically a property where you execute a method when you retrieve a value. Allows you to add more complex logic. They are defined like methods, and require you to return something.

```js
private lastReport: string;

get mostRecentReport() {
  if (this.lastReport) return this.lastReport;
  throw new Error("No report found!");
}

const lastReport = accountingDepartment.mostRecentReport;
// const lastReport = accountingDepartment.mostRecentReport(); // NO! Do not treat it as a method!
```

- A Getter is useful when we want to add logical checks or need to take multiple steps in order to derive the value we wish to return.
- Useful when working in conjunction with private / protected properties, where we don't want the user to alter the value directly, as we encapulate how the value is handled in our Getter itself.
- You don't execute it as a method! Just treat it like a normal property, and behind-the-scenes it will execute the method.

** Setter **

Using the `set` keyword, we can define a **setter**

```js
set mostRecentReport(value: string) {
  // Logic to set most recent report, e.g.:
  if (!value) {
    throw new Error("Please pass in a valid value!");
  }
  // ... Etc
}
```

Setters and Getters are great for encapsulating logic and for adding extra logic for when you try to read or set a property.

### Static Methods & Properties

Static methods & properties are another useful concept related to properties and methods, which are also available in JS ES6 and later, as well as of course TS!

- Allow you to add properties and methods to Classes which are not accessed on an instance of a class, but rather the class itself
- Often used for utility functions, or global constants
- The Math object is an example of this -- we never instantiate an instance of Math to access its properties or methods

We simply add the `static` keyword in front of a property or method:

```js
static createEmployee(name: string) {
// Logic,
employees.push({ name });
}

Department.createEmployee("Matthew");
```

- When you `static` on a class, you cannot access them in non-static methods (constructor as well) using the `this` keyword, since those methods are being called on an instance of an object
- If you want access them inside non-static methods, you would use the `Classname.fieldname` syntax, such as `Department.numEmployees`
- Cannot mark the constructor as `static`

### Abstract Classes
